## Project Title:
```DrEYEve``` — Perception System for Autonomous Vehicles Using NVDLA 

## Project Description:
Autonomous Vehicles are gaining popularity in the world of cars, and self-driven cars are being desired across the globe. With automated driving becoming a plausible feature of the future, we hope to address a key feature that ensures safety and efficiency by detecting objects and obstacles on roads and helps with path planning for vehicles: visual perception. The most important feature that come into play to give a car 'eyes' that are useful is the capability to process images accurately and quickly. This requires a system with high computational power. Since this system is to be deployed in vehicles, a desirable feature is energy efficiency. With high computational power and energy efficiency being the prime target features for improvement, we propose to implement a visual perception system on the Open-source NVDLA platform, using the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm.

The main steps for implementation are as follows:
- Choose a pre-trained YOLOv5 model and implement it for the chosen dataset.
- Convert YOLOv5 to ONNX format.
- Optimize the model with TensorRT.
- Load optimized model onto NVDLA platform and run inference.
- Performance Tuning: Quantization and Profiling
